CSCI355-CMS Project Part 3
===========
In this part of the project you will edit **newpost.php**. This is the only file 
you should need to edit.  I've marked the section of code you will be interested in.  
You do not need to edit anything outside this code section.  I've put hints in throughout.  

You will be doing two things:
* Rewriting the SQL queries using paramaterized queries.
* Change the new post implementation to use a transaction


To run your project open php/index.php and click Run at the top.

Project Part 3 Deliverables
===========
You will need to do the following for 100%.
* Change the 3 SQL queries so they no longer have SQL injection
* Implement a transaction so either the post and tags are all inserted or none are
